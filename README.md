# NodeLoggerg

A simple logging manager for Node.js that helps manage logging for your application. It writes logs to both the console and a log file. You can easily configure the log levels and the location of the log file.

## Features

- **Log Levels**: Supports different log levels (`info`, `warn`, `error`, `debug`).
- **Timestamped Logs**: Automatically adds timestamps to your log messages.
- **File Output**: Logs are written to a file (default location is `logs/app.log`).
- **Console Output**: Logs are also output to the console (can be disabled).
- **Customizable Log File Location**: The location of the log file can be configured.

## Installation

You can install this package via npm:

```bash
npm install nodeloggerg
